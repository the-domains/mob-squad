The Cali Clasico was a great time this past Saturday at Cashman Field. The Galaxy defeated the Earthquakes 1-0 thanks to a Gyassi Zardes first-half goal from which the Quakes were not able to match. The game itself was decent with both teams still working off their pre-season rust but what made the night fun was the atmosphere. Both the San Jose Ultras and Angel City brigade were in full voice and the constant back and forth singing was a blast to experience. We are even more psyched for the Mobsters season to start!

As far as the tailgate went it was fabulous as usual. Met some new folks that should be making it out to the matches, ate great food and drank great beer. Tailgate. Mission. Accomplished.
